# Hide From The Monster (tiny browser game)

A simple HTML/Canvas game: you (blue) run around with arrow keys and hide behind walls to avoid the monster (red).

## Run locally

Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Controls

- Move: Arrow keys or WASD
- Restart: R

## Rules

- If the monster touches you: you lose.
- If you survive 30 seconds: you win.
- Walls block line-of-sight; when the monster can’t see you, it patrols.
